    <h2>Hi, my name is Alison Mazzarella-Woelzl</h2>
    <p>I received an associates in Applied Health from BYUI in 2017, and decided to go back to school and pursue a
        bachelors in Applied Technology.</p>
    <p>I am aiming to become a Python Developer, however I'm only haf way through my studies so I would like to keep an
        open mind.</p>
    <p>I've been married for going on 6 years in May, and we have one fur baby named Mr. Bean.</p>
    <p>In my free time I enjoy reading fantasy novels, pc gaming, going to concerts, and taking long walks with my
        family.</p>
    <p>Currently I work part-time as a social media manager for a breeder/boarding facility. I help with site
        maintenance for their website.</p>
    <p>When I received my associates in 2017 online majors were still relatively new. There weren't many options, or
        advising. Things are so different now and I'm grateful to be back.</p>
