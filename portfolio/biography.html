        <h1>Who Am I</h1>
        <p>
            Am I an American expat living in Vienna, Austria? Or perhaps a dog mom to a very rambuncious fur baby named Mr. Bean? Maybe I am a tech student hoping to graduate
            at almost 30 years old? Yes, all of those things are true, but i'm also so much more. I'm a dreamer, tireless in pursuit of my passions. A problem solver, someone
            who leaves no stone unturned til things are right. An optimist, knowing that the right opportunities come to those who actively search for them.

            Born and raised in South Florida I always had a knack for web design. By 13 I had created my first website. It was minimal and consisted of two web pages, but it was glorious. 
            While studying health sciences at BYU-Idaho I couldn't stop electing to take technology and web design classes. Those classes thrilled me the most. 
            Ultimately I abandoned health in favor of technology, and it was the best decision I ever made.
            I have since worked on and completed over 5 websites from scratch for various class projects and clients, and I can proudly say I'm just getting started!

            So that brings me to where I am today. After being passed on for many internships, where I had hoped to display my skills for possible employers, I decided the best way to prove what I know is before the hiring process even begins. 
            In this digital portfolio, in the form of a website, you will come to see the types of skills and knowledge I contain on the topic of web design. 
            Actions speak louder than words so I am hopeful you will see this website as a sign that I am capable and ready to provide solutions to your next project!
