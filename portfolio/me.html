        <h4>Born and raised in South Florida, I have always had a love for science and technology. After spending some time pursuing Epidemiology I decided I preferred the technical aspect of science over the health side. Through hard work and perserverance you can achieve anything you want in life, I strongly believe that so I guess you could say I am an optimist. In my opinion there is no skill you can't learn, no career you can't pursue, and no job you can't become qualified for if you have the desire. My work ethic is to always remain passionate about what you're learning, and motivated to improve and do better. Besides work I am married to a wonderful Austrian who is constantly showing me new and exciting cultures throughout Europe. We are parents to a rambuncious teenage dog named Mr. Bean, who is very much a spoiled only child. We spend most of our free time wondering around our hometown Vienna, and eating everything bad for you.</h4>
