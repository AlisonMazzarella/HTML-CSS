      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Everyone knows that actions speak louder than words. Why tell you what I can offer your company when I can show you. Here you will see a 
          visual representation of the types of skills and creativity I have for web design. Take a look around, engage with the content, and visualize the
          kind of solutions I can bring to your next project. 
      </p> 


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It's been quite the journey to get to where I am today. After many internship rejections I decided I was tired of trying to verbally convince 
          potential employers that I was a capable web designer. Hence the reason for this digital portfolio. I figured nothing can adequately get my point across
          like visual evidence of my claims. So this is for you potential employers. I have created this digital portfolio to wow you with my skills, and so you no longer
          have to take my word for it.

      <p>
        I have created this digital portfolio as an opportunity to showcase my skills in Web Designing and Implementation. A passion of mine is creating
        interactive websites that allow the user to explore site content the way they want to.  Sprinkled throughout my digital portfolio you will find 
        hyperlinks leading the user to subpages with more in-depth information, along with images specifically selected to enhance the information being
        presented on each page. Besides information the user should also get a feel for the websites tone based on the color pallete chosen, and the fonts used. 
        Every aspect of a websites creation matters as it adds to the overall vibe and website aesthetic. You want to give the user the opportunity to interact with 
        the website the way they want to as a client or consumer, while evoking certain feelings from them through the use of palletes, images, and overall layout.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Born and raised in South Florida, I have always had a love for science and technology. After spending some time pursuing Epidemiology I decided I preferred the technical aspect of science over the health side. 
        Through hard work and perserverance you can achieve anything you want in life, I strongly believe that so I guess you could say I am an optimist. 
        In my opinion there is no skill you can't learn, no career you can't pursue, and no job you can't become qualified for if you have the desire. My work ethic is to always 
        remain passionate about what you're learning, and motivated to improve and do better. Besides work I am married to a wonderful Austrian who is constantly showing me new
        and exciting cultures throughout Europe. We are parents to a rambuncious teenage dog named Mr. Bean, who is very much a spoiled only child. We spend most of our free
        time wondering around our hometown Vienna, and eating everything bad for you.
